# Explorer

The Accumulate Explorer provides users with a real-time view of the Accumulate Blockchain. The Explorer can be used to view transactions, Lite Accounts, and ADI Token accounts. Searches are performed by providing either an account URL or a TXID. The explorer can be accessed [here](https://explorer.accumulatenetwork.io/).

Searching either a Lite Account or ADI returns the account's current status, along with the transaction history.  Along with the account balance, this search also returns the Token type associated with the account, the current balance, and the credit balance. Clicking on a transaction ID will run a transaction search using that TXID. This is no different than entering the ID manually and running a search.

Searching for a Transaction ID returns the Synthetic Token Deposit, Parent TXID, the address of the sender and receiver, and the number of tokens that were sent.

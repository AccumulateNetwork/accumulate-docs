# Getting Started

The purpose of this documentation is to give a general overview of Accumulate and to serve as a starting point for new users. 

Accumulate is a brand new Blockchain protocol, and as is typical of new software, will be evolving often. This documentation will evolve with it, but may be a bit behind new changes.

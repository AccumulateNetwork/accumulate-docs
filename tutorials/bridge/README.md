# Accumulate Bridge Guides

The [**Accumulate Bridge**](https://bridge.accumulatenetwork.io) is a decentralized bridge that allows users to transfer ACME and other Accumulate tokens between Ethereum and Accumulate. It was created by [De Facto](https://de-facto.pro), a leading supporter of the Accumulate Network. The bridge was created to enable interoperability between Accumulate and different blockchain networks, starting with Ethereum.

To facilitate cross-chain transfers, the Accumulate Bridge uses a technology based on [Darknodes](https://docs.renproject.io/darknodes/) which was created by the [renBridge](https://bridge.renproject.io/welcome) project. Darknodes are specialized nodes that act as gatekeepers between different blockchain networks. They verify transactions on one blockchain network and mint an equivalent amount of tokens on another blockchain network, which can then be used by users on that network.

The Accumulate Bridge currently supports transfers of ACME between Ethereum and Accumulate. \

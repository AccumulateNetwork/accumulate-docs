## TestNet

The TestNet is a secondary production Accumulate network intended for exploratory work. TestNet tokens do not have monetary value.

Currently, the TestNet BVCs and nodes are hard-coded in `networks.go`. There are currently three TestNet BVCs: Arches, American Samoa, and EastXeons. The TestNet does not currently include a DC.

## DevNet

The DevNet is an Accumulate network used for development and validation. The DevNet may be reinitialized, with all history discarded, at any time.

# Welcome

Accumulate is a novel blockchain network designed to be hugely scalable while maintaining security. The purpose of this documentation is to give a general overview of Accumulate and to serve as a starting point for new users.

Developers should find everything they need in the [Developers](broken-reference) section.

If you would like to run your own Accumulate node, check out the [Operators](broken-reference) section.

If you would like to learn more about the technical concepts and the unique design choices of Accumulate, then the [Deep Dive section](broken-reference) is for you.

Accumulate is a brand new Blockchain protocol, and as is typical of new software, will be evolving often. This documentation will evolve with it, but may be a bit behind new changes.

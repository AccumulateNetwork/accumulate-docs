# Networks

## MainNet

The MainNet is the primary Accumulate network.

{% hint style="danger" %}
The MainNet will not be created until testing and development is done
{% endhint %}

## TestNet

`https://testnet.accumulatenetwork.io`

{% hint style="info" %}
TestNet history may be reset at the discretion of DeFi Devs. Generally, this will happen for minor releases or history-breaking bugs.
{% endhint %}

The TestNet is a secondary production Accumulate network intended for exploratory work. TestNet tokens do not have value. TestNet history may be reset at any time.

**Types Of Testnet**

* Stable Testnet
* Beta Testnet

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Stable Testnet" %}
The stable testnet uses the v0.6 tag on Github and Gitlab and will remain so until the mainnet launch. The endpoint for the stable testnet is “testnet.accumulatenetwork.io” and the branch for the CLI is “cli-v0.6”. You can use the Accumulate explorer to view the transactions on this version of the network at the main mirror ([https://explorer.accumulatenetwork.io](https://explorer.accumulatenetwork.io/))&#x20;
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Beta Testnet" %}
The beta testnet uses the v0.7 tag on Github and Gitlab. The endpoint is `beta.testnet.accumulatenetwork.io,` and the branch for the CLI is `cli-0.7.0-beta.` You can use the Accumulate explorer to view transactions on this version of the network at [https://beta.explorer.accumulatenetwork.io](https://beta.explorer.accumulatenetwork.io/).&#x20;
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}



## DevNet

`https://devnet.accumulatenetwork.io`

{% hint style="info" %}
DevNet history is reset frequently, by continuous deployment on the `develop` branch and devnet is bleeding edge and very unstable.
{% endhint %}

The DevNet is an Accumulate network used for development and validation. The DevNet may be reinitialized, with all history discarded, at any time.

The devnet uses the `develop branch` and the endpoint is  You can use the Accumulate explorer to view transactions on this version of the network at[ ](https://dev.explorer.accumulatenetwork.io/)[https://dev.explorer.accumulatenetwork.io/](https://dev.explorer.accumulatenetwork.io/).&#x20;

Since the devnet is changing rapidly, we encourage you to use the stable or beta testnet.

# Fees

Accumulates fees are fixed and stable. Business models, built on Accumulate, can rely on a predictable cost model to support their go-to-market strategies today and tomorrow.

Estimated fees below are converted to USD for actions like identity creation, token transactions, and token issuances.

#### Multi-Operation Transactions

* SendTokens, IssueTokens - charge 1.00 credit for each output after the first
  * One output costs 3, two costs 4, three costs 5, etc.
* UpdateKeyPage, UpdateAccountAuth - charge 1.00 credit for each operation after the first
  * One operation costs 3, two costs 4, three costs 5, etc.
* CreateKeyPage - charge 1.00 credit for each key after the first
  * One key costs 100, two costs 101, three costs 102, etc.
* Delegation - charge 0.01 credit for each layer of delegation
  * A basic (non-delegated) signature costs 0.01, a delegated signature costs 0.02, a double-delegated signature costs 0.03, etc.

#### Sliding fee schedule

Short ADIs cost more. The length of an ADI is calculated as the number of bytes of the UTF-8 encoded string minus the `.acme` suffix, _not the number of characters_. For example, `å±‹.acme` and `abc.acme` are both counted as 3 bytes long. The schedule will likely change prior to launch. The current schedule is:

| Length | Cost                     | Length | Cost                 |
| ------ | ------------------------ | ------ | -------------------- |
| 1      | $20480 / 2048000 credits | 7      | $320 / 32000 credits |
| 2      | $10240 / 1024000 credits | 8      | $160 / 16000 credits |
| 3      | $5120 / 512000 credits   | 9      | $80 / 8000 credits   |
| 4      | $2560 / 32000 credits    | 10     | $40 / 4000 credits   |
| 5      | $1280 / 128000 credits   | 11     | $20 / 2000 credits   |
| 6      | $640 / 64000 credits     | 12     | $10 / 1000 credits   |

{% hint style="info" %}
All transactions incur a 0.1 credit fee per for each 256 bytes over a base 256 bytes. The additional fee is 0.01 credits instead of 0.1 if it is a scratch transaction. Signatures incur a 0.01 credit fee for each 256 bytes over a base 256 bytes.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
Except for send tokens, failed transactions paying fees over 1 credit will be refunded less 1 credit. No refund is made for fees less than or equal to 1 credit.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
For send token transactions each failed output will refund 1 credit.&#x20;

# Support

Accumulate is free and open-source for users who wish to work on a Blockchain protocol. Our [Discord](https://discord.gg/XAy9Mm6mPC) or [Telegram](https://t.me/accumulatenetwork) is a great first place to reach out for help when having an issue or a question. In addition, the Accumulate community and core developers often check this platform and answer posts.&#x20;

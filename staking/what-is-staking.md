# What is staking

Holders of ACME have the option to stake their digital assets to put them to use and generate passive revenue without having to sell them.&#x20;

&#x20;\
Staking can be compared to investing money in a high-yield savings account in the world of cryptocurrencies. The bank takes the money you deposit in a savings account and often loans it to other people. You receive a percentage of the interest from lending in exchange for keeping that money in the bank, although a very, very small portion.&#x20;

**All staked tokens will be hard-locked until May 5th, 2023.** Staked tokens will be completely inaccessible (cannot be withdrawn or unstaked) until after this date.

### There are three ways to stake your ACME tokens:

#### **Pure staking**&#x20;

Pure staking is staking your tokens solely for the purpose of staking them (and receiving rewards). Pure staking requires a minimum staked balance of 50,000 ACME. Pure staking has no risk of slashing and comes with no obligations but generates lower yields than operator staking.

**Pure Staking has a waitlist. Please fill out this** [**form.**](https://forms.gle/W8cThDbS9xT2VBc89)

#### **Operator staking**&#x20;

Registered operators of protocol nodes must maintain a minimum staked balance of 50,000 ACME. Registered operators have obligations and hardware expenditures depending on the type of node they run and may be slashed for downtime, negligence, abuse of their privileges, and other offenses. Registered operators are rewarded at a higher rate than pure stakers.

#### **Delegated staking**&#x20;

Delegated staking is delegating your staked tokens to another pure staker or operator. Delegated staking requires a minimum staked balance of 1,000 ACME. The staker you delegate to takes a 10% fee from the rewards generated by your staked tokens. If you delegate to an operator, your tokens generate higher yields than if you delegate to a pure staker. However, if you delegate to an operator and the operator is slashed, your stake is also slashed.
